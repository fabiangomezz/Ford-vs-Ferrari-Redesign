Hello my name is Fabian Gomez, and for my Capstone project I chose to do a sound Redesign of the movie Ford vs Ferrari. To add on top of that I chose to make the project using Dolby Atmos. 
Atmos is a spatialization software that movies use to run sound from speaker to speaker in movie theaters and other locations. 

This project was a ton of fun for me as not only did it make me a better sound editor but it forced me to use software that I am not comfortable with. I have linked youtube videos for a look at my session with explainations and play through of the movie with the renderer open so that you can see how it is moving in real time.
