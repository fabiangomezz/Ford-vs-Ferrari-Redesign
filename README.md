Hello my name is Fabian Gomez, and for my Capstone project I chose to do a sound Redesign of the movie Ford vs Ferrari. To add on top of that I chose to make the project using Dolby Atmos. 
Atmos is a spatialization software that movies use to run sound from speaker to speaker in movie theaters and other locations.
